Energy Saving Solution For Campus development

Class Room occupancy detection is done using Yolov5 model as our backbone.
The poistion of people in the image is obtained from YOLO. The room is spatially divided into grids each of which corresponds to a particular fan and light.
This computation is done in a central raspberry pi server and is remotely communicated to the master relay swicth either through common LAN network or over the internet.
Each room will be fitted with a modular camera based built from ESP CAM.
